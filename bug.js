```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  The issue might arise if the `gradient-to-r` class isn't working as expected, leading to the background not displaying the gradient correctly.
