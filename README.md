# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Tailwind CSS gradient doesn't render correctly. The gradient is supposed to transition smoothly between two colors, but instead, it displays only one color. This can be caused by several factors, such as incorrect class names, missing dependencies, or conflicts with other CSS styles.

## Bug Description

The provided code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to apply a linear gradient to a div element. The gradient should transition from blue to purple, but only the starting color (blue) is displayed.  The issue is reproduced in multiple browsers.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the Tailwind CSS configuration and ensuring that the gradient classes are correctly applied and that there are no conflicting styles.
